# Frontend Mentor Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of all my completed Frontend Mentor challenges over the years.

For a year, I have worked on various Frontend Mentor projects to improve my frontend development skills. This repo serves as an archive of my progress, practice, and experimentation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frontend technologies.

I havenâ€™t been active on Frontend Mentor for the past 2 years, but I wanted to keep these projects here as a portfolio of my work.

## How to Use

You can browse each project folder to view the source code. Most projects can be opened directly in a browser by opening their respective index.html files.
